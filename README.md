## Using Libraries 

The navigation library facilitates smoother transitions within the app.

The Material library enables us to better handle design-related elements.

The Retrofit library allows fetching data from the internet, processing it, and provides the opportunity to asynchronously fetch data in the background.

The RXJava library is a complementary library to Retrofit. It assists us as operations become more complex.

The Glide library is used for fetching and displaying images from the internet.

The Preference library is one of the Jetpack libraries. It is used for remembering user preferences.
